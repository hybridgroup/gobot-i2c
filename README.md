# gobot-i2c

Gobot (http://gobot.io/) is a library for robotics and physical computing using Go

This library provides drivers for i2c devices (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C). You would not normally use this library directly, instead it is used by Gobot adaptors that have i2c support.

## Getting Started
Install the library with: `go get -u github.com/hybridgroup/gobot-i2c`

## Examples
```go

## Hardware Support
Gobot has a extensible system for connecting to hardware devices. The following i2c devices are currently supported:

More drivers are coming soon...
